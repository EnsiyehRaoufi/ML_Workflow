# ML_Workflow

Here you can see my AWS workflows. After a lot of efforts my first workflow has been created and I shared its AWS definition code and also its creation code using step functions. 

The final Project was so challenging to me and I spent a lot of time debugging and troubleshooting my codes including Lambda functions, Step Functions, etc. 
Here I've added solution to my final workflow project as a zip file.
